                <h2>Chris: How Media and Language Shape Our World</h2>
                
                <h3>My Story</h3>
                <p>My literacy experiences were influenced by a plethora of medias to television and books, changing how I view writing in general. Chapter 2 of Reading and Writing for Conversational Inquiry showed how literacy and writing can be shaped not just in classrooms, but also through everyday experiences like television, spoken languages, and cultural traditions. In my own childhood, English was not my first language, but my introduction to cartoons and PBS was a change to my literacy journey. Shows such as Sesame Street and The Mister Roger’s show, giving me lessons I still hold to this day. My experience in reading and shows I watched while growing up, helped form my writing voice, the way I tell stories, and how I express ideas. Overall, I see reading as not just academic, but influenced around the habits, languages, and cultural messages.</p>

                <p>The source provided, hispanicmama.com, explains that children’s shows in Latin America highlighted how programs such as El Chavo del Ocho and Topo Gigio were more than entertainment, they were a source of showing community, values and language.</p>
