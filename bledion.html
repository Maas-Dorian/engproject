                <h3>My Story</h3>
                <p>This relates to me because I like learning about different cultures and how people live I personally have lots of interactions with various cultures, having lived in more than 1 country, speaking multiple languages and visiting numerous countries in my life. Patsy C. Robertson’s ideas showed me that it’s important to tell stories that are fair and respectful, take time to understand others cultures and identities. It made me think more about how I write and how I can include different experiences in my work.</p>
