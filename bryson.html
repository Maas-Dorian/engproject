                <h3>My Story</h3>
                <p>I was born in New Albany, Indiana but I grew up in Scottsburg, Indiana. Scottsburg is a rural community with not a lot to do. It was one of those places that only had McDonalds, Walmart, and dollar general. Growing up in this setting I was not indoors a lot. I always wanted to be outside either helping my dad around the yard or playing a sport with my brothers. Spending most of my time outside led to me not watching a ton of tv shows, but my favorite movie when I was a kid was Cars. According to Andrea Lunsford in the text "Writing Is Informed by Prior Experience" our experiences and interactions shape our writing. She found out through experiments that a lot of people had many negative early experiences with writing which led to their current dislike of the skill. This is just one example of an experience that can affect your writing. An example of an environment affecting your writing and literacy is I have the habit of saying and typing the words "ain't" and "y'all".</p>
